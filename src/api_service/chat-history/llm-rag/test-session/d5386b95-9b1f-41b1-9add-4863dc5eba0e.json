Unfortunately, I don't have access to your workout history for today, so I can't tell you whether you've already worked out. \n\nLooking at your activity levels over the past few months, it seems like you're quite active, frequently exceeding 10,000 steps a day. It's important to listen to your body and factor in rest days to allow for muscle recovery and prevent injury. \n\nIf you're feeling energized and haven't worked out yet today, then go for it! If you're feeling sore or tired, consider taking a rest day or doing some light stretching or yoga. Remember, consistency is key in the long run. \n"
