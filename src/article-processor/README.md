### Run Container
Run the startup script which makes building & running the container easy.

- Make sure you are inside the `article-processor` folder and open a terminal at this location
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh`
- After container startup, test the shell by running `python cli.py --help`

Create a secrets folder at the same level as the `src` folder.
This folder should contain:
 - finetuning-service-account.json: The credentials file connected to a gAIn GCP Service account with the necessary permissions:
   - `Storage Admin`
   - `Vertex AI User`

### Generate Text
- Run `python cli.py --generate` to generate a health-related QA dataset
- Change any of the default parameters

### Sample Question Answers

Here are some sample results from when you run the `--generate` option from the above step:

```

  {
    "question": "What are the key principles of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and its benefits for both physical and cognitive health?",
    "answer": "HIIT is fantastic for maximizing efficiency! It involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods.  For example, 30 seconds of sprinting followed by 30 seconds of rest, repeated for 15-20 minutes.  This approach improves cardiovascular fitness, burns calories efficiently, and has shown potential cognitive benefits, including improved memory and attention.  However, proper warm-up and cool-down are crucial to avoid injuries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the best approach for building muscle mass and strength, combining both diet and exercise strategies?",
    "answer": "To build muscle, you need a comprehensive strategy!  Focus on strength training exercises that target major muscle groups, using compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.  Aim for 3-4 sessions per week, allowing sufficient rest for muscle recovery.  Your diet is crucial; consume sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight) to support muscle growth.  Prioritize complex carbohydrates and healthy fats for energy.  Remember, consistency and progressive overload (gradually increasing weight or reps) are key."
  },

```

### Prepare Dataset
The text generated by the LLM needs to be converted to a csv and jsonl format that we will use to fine-tune a LLM. We also perform test / train split.

- Run `python cli.py --prepare`
- This step will combine all the `.txt` files are consolidate it into csv and jsonl files.
- It will also perform a test / train split.

### Upload Dataset
In this step we upload our dataset to a GCP bucket so we can using it in our downstream tasks.

- Run `python cli.py --upload`
